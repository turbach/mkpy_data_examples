<h2>event codes vs. variables<a class="headerlink" href="#event-codes-vs-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In brainwave experiments, the timing of events that occur while the
EEG data are recorded is often tracked by logging a time-stamped
integer event code. The timestamp indicates when the event occured in
relation to the EEG recording and the integer value identifies the
type of event. For example, the event code may indicate the stimulus
(1 = beep, 2 = boop) or response (3 for a left hand button press, 4
for a right).</p>
<p>In very simple single factor experiments, the integer code itself can
serve as a predictor variable for modeling the data. For instance,
integer event codes for two stimulus types, beep = 0 and boop = 1
treatment code the stimulus variable with beep as the reference
level. Alternatively the variable can be sum (deviation) coded as beep
= -1 and boop = 1. So in this kind of case, integer event codes
can be read off the data log and dropped into a model (modeling
software) without modification. For the vast majority of real science,
event codes must be re-coded, i.e., systematically transformed or
mapped, to other representations for purposes of modeling the
data. There are several reasons.</p>
<p>The event codes logged with the data recording are fossilized –
encased in digital amber, immutable. They can encode a treatment
coding or a sum coding but not both. If a different coding is required
(Reviewer #2 insists), the original codes cannot be used directly.
This is not a problem in practice because you can confess to your
modeling software that the integer codes are really just category
labels anyway and then specify which categorical coding scheme to use
for constructing the model (design) matrix. It is convenient that for
this simple special case, someone else has solved the problem of
re-mapping our integer event codes for purposes of modeling the data
and we can get on with our work. The important point is that even in
this simplest of cases, the event codes as originally logged with the
data had to be recoded after the fact for modeling the data. Recoding
fossilized event codes is the general problem, and statistical
modeling sofware does not have a general solution.</p>
<p>The core issue is that models need quantities and although event codes
are logged as integers, they are actually simple event labels or tags
that uniquely identify the event (type or token) that occurred. In
place of codes 1 and 2, labels like “a” and “b” or “beep” and “boop”
would do just as well if the data acquisition hardware were able to
log and timestamp character strings. Event codes are simple in the
sense that contrasts with complex: a unit with no smaller parts. To
uniquely code a set of four events, the following codings do exactly
the same job: {1, 2, 3, 4}, {“a”, “b”, “c”, “d”}, {11, 12, 21, 22}. To
simplify computation, the current crop of statistical modeling
software (R, statsmodels, SAS, SPSS, SYSTAT) wants the data arranged
in a tabular format: observations in rows, response (dependent) and
predictor (independent) variables in columns. For models with more
than one independent (predictor) variable, the 2-D data table will
encode the variables as multiple columns. This means that for modeling
the data, each time an event is observed (one row), it must be
assigned to the (many) correct values of the predictor variable
columns. Since the event code is a single label, i.e., a 1 or “beep”
or 11, dropping it into the variable columns does not correctly
specify the model. Using logged event codes directly as predictor
variables can only work in simple designs with one factor. It does not
generalize to multiple predictor variables.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the relationship between logged integer event codes and
predictor variables in models of real interest is rarely fully
specified when the data are initially recorded. The sequence of events
is not fixed when there is opportunity for human interaction as there
is in any design which involves behavioral responses. For instance
when the event code for a target stimulus is logged, there is no way
to know whether it was detected (“hit”) or not (“miss) until a
response is made later. This means the experimental variable
“accuracy” cannot be read off the stimulus event code alone, it is
contingent on a sequence of codes. Furthermore, the relevant factors
and levels may not have been built into the integer codes in the first
place. Perhaps your first hypothesis was a bust and you want to
investigate other variables.  Or Reviewer #2 has a pet theory and
insists some variable be included. The integer event codes fossilized
in the recording have to be recoded after the fact for the variables
you or Reviewer 2 now want to model.</p>
<p>So besides the fact that event codes are simple labels not quantities,
a further problem is that the time-stamped integer event codes are
fixed once and for all when the data are first recorded but the
variables associated with the event for modeling often are not. The
obvious solution is a look-up table that maps the logged event codes
to the appropriate values of the predictor variables. Though
conceptually straightforward, there are a few complications in
practice.</p>
<p>The variables associated with a specific event are often contingent on
whether other events occur and if so when.  The variables always
depend on the model and there are always alternative models. The
events may be initially coded for event type, e.g., codes 1 and 2 for
congruous and incongruous words and the codes may not differentiate
other relevant attributes of the events, e.g., differences in length,
familiarity, age of acquisition of the individual words of the two
types. This means that in practice, the form of the relationship
(mapping) between individual fossilized event codes and the (levels
of) categorical and (values of) continuous predictor variables
included in a given model might be anything: one-to-one, one-to-many,
many-to-one, or many-to_many.</p>

<h2>code tagging<a class="headerlink" href="#code-tagging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The code tagging approach automates arbitrary mappings from integer
event code (sequences) to categorical and continous predictor
variables for some common cases in designed experiments. The general
framework is built around tidy tabular data structures which
simplifies the implementation of custom re-coding for cases that are
not handled by the automation.</p>

<dt><strong>codemap</strong></dt><dd><p>The <em>codemap</em> is a <strong>recipe</strong> for re-coding (tagging) integer event
codes with the additional categorical and continuous experimental
variables (tags) as required for modeling real world experimental
data in informative ways.</p>
<p>The codemap is a table (rows x columns) where each row is has the form,
<em>pattern tag, …, tag</em>. This says, “any numerical event code
(sequence) that matches this regular-expression-like <em>pattern</em>, gets
these <em>tags</em>”.</p>
<p>The sample portion of a codemap shown next re-codes integer event 10
as a hit, miss, or one of two types of anticipation error of
depending on what the response code is (1040, 1064) and whether it
occurs after or before the code following the 10. It also tags 10
with .25, the numeric value of the continuous the continuous
predictor variable “prob”, which gives the probability of the
stimulus associated with code 10 in the stimlulus sequence. This is
a stimulus attribute, i.e., not contingent on the response but
potentially useful to encode for this and the rest of the stimuli if
we are interested in the relationships between probability and
accuracy and/or their impact on the EEG response variable we are
modeling.</p>

<p>The mapping between the patterns and the tags in a codemap is
restricted only in that each pattern gets the same number of tags.
The code patterns can be mapped to tags one-one, one-many, many-one,
many-many as needed.</p>
<p>Depending on the specifics of the code pattern and the data, each
code pattern may match the event data any number of times. A
cooperative and attentive participant may not make any anticipation
errors, others may.</p>
<p>Critically, the codemap is also an event <strong>filter</strong>. In the real
experimental world, the event log is typicaly a record of many kinds
of events. Some subsets of events are relevant for some analyses of
the brain activity, other subsets for other analyses, and some are
critically important for the experiment, but not directly relevant
to the time course of brain activity, e.g., logging information
about the sequence of trials and states of the stimulus delivery and
data recording apparatus. A codemap dives into the overpopulated
event stream and returns with a whitelist of all and only those
events relevant for a particular analysis. Since analyses answer
questions and, in general, there is more than one question that
might be usefully asked of a given dataset, in general, there will
be more than one codemap.</p>

<p><strong>event table</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Whereas the codemap is the recipe for linking events with
experimental variables, the <em>event table</em> is the <strong>result</strong> of
sweeping the code patterns across the recorded event data and
collecting the matches in rows x columns. This creates a tidy,
lightweight lookup table, where each row</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>shows exactly where to find the event in the digital data stream,
<em>i</em>-th digital sample index.</p></li>
<li><p>the immutable event code as digitally recorded in the original
data stream (plus other information relevant to for checking data
integrity.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>and</strong> the highly and necessarily mutable categorical and
continuous variables the analyst deem relevant for modeling brain
activity in relation to the event which may be in many-many
relations to the immutable event codes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By design, the tabular rows=observations x columns=variables format
of the event table is the same as the familiar observations x
variables data format assumed by statistical modeling software like
statsmodels and patsy in Python and lm and lme4 in R and can be
broadcast from the event sample to other data samples, e.g., in a
fixed length epoch. In the event table the digital event code is
simply another tag for the event, one among many.</p>
<p>The rows and columns of the event table can and should be inspected
to verify that codes were correctly matched and tagged.</p>
<p>Event tables may be further modified, e.g., by</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>pruning unnecessary rows (matched events) or columns (tags)</p></li>
<li><p>adding more tags (columns) from other data sources</p></li>
<li><p>adding more matched events (rows) by stacking or slicing the rows
of other same-shape event tables from the same HDF5 file.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>epochs</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Epochs are fixed-length segments of the EEG and event recordings,
time-stamped relative to a pattern-matched event code at time = 0
and tagged with the column variables from the event table. To get
the epochs data for modeling, the information in the event table is
stashed alongside the EEG recordings as an <em>epochs table</em> by
providing a name and fixed-length epoch interval boundaries relative
to the matched event at time 0 (<em>pre</em>, <em>post</em>). The EEG epochs can
then be extracted from the HDF5 data file by name as a tidy table of
indexed tagged tabular multi-channel time-series data. The epochs
data can be read into the Python environment or exported as a
separate file in various data interchange formats:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>native HDF5 (<em>h5</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>pandas.DataFrame pytables HDF5Store (<cite>pdh5</cite>)</p></li>
<li><p><cite>feather</cite></p></li>
</ul>
<p>For working in Python <cite>feather</cite>, <cite>h5</cite>, and <cite>pdh5</cite> all work.  The
feather format is incrementally larger but much faster to read with
pandas. For working in R <cite>feather</cite> is easiest, <cite>h5</cite> also works.  For
working in MATLAB, <cite>h5</cite> is easiest.</p>
<p>In the epochs data, the single trial EEG, the fossilized stimulus
and response event codes, and the new stimulus and response variable
tags all travel together. This makes it straightforward to verify
event codes are tagged correctly and to synchronize single trial
EEG and response measures and anlaysis.</p>
