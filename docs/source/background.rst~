event codes vs. variables
-------------------------

In brainwave experiments, the timing of events that occur while the
EEG data are recorded is often tracked by logging a time-stamped
integer event code. The timestamp indicates when the event occured in
relation to the EEG recording and the integer value identifies the
type of event. For example, the event code may indicate the stimulus
(1 = beep, 2 = boop) or response (3 for a left hand button press, 4
for a right).

In very simple single factor experiments, the integer code itself can
serve as a predictor variable for modeling the data. For instance
integer event codes for two stimulus types, beep = 0 and boop = 1
treatment code the stimulus variable with beep as the reference
level. Alternatively the variable can be sum (deviation) coded as beep
= -1 boop = 1. So in this kind of case, integer event codes can be
read off the data log and dropped into a model (modeling software)
without modification. For the vast majority of real science, event
codes must be re-coded, i.e., systematically transformed or mapped, to
other representations for purposes of modeling the data. There are
several reasons.

The event codes logged with the data recording are fossilized --
encased in digital amber, immutable. They can encode a treatment
coding or a sum coding but not both. If the other coding is required
(Reviewer #2 insists) the original codes cannot be used directly.
This is not a problem in practice because you can confess to your
modeling software that the integer codes are really just category
labels anyway and then specify which categorical coding scheme to use
for constructing the model (design) matrix. It is convenient that for
this simple special case, someone else has solved the problem of
re-mapping our integer event codes for purposes of modeling the data
and we can get on with our work. The important point is that even in
this simplest of cases, the event codes as originally logged with the
data had to be recoded after the fact for modeling the data. Recoding
fossilized event codes is the general problem, and statistical
modeling sofware does not have a general solution.

A general issue is that event codes are codes. Although logged as
integers, they serve as simple event labels or tags that uniquely
identify the event (type or token) that occurred. In place of 0, 1,
labels like "a" and "b" or "beep" and "boop" would do just as well if
the data acquisition hardware were able to log and timestamp character
strings. Event codes are simple in the sense that contrasts with
complex: a unit with no smaller parts. To uniquely code a set of four
events, the following codings do exactly the same job: {1, 2, 3, 4},
{"a", "b", "c", "d"}, {11, 12, 21, 22}. To simplify computation, the
current crop of statistical modeling software (R, statsmodels, SAS,
SPSS, SYSTAT) wants the data arranged in a tabular format:
observations in rows, response (dependent) and predictor (independent)
variables in columns. For models with more than one independent
(predictor) variable, the 2-D data table will encode the variables as
multiple columns. This means that for modeling the data, each time an
event is observed (one row), it must be assigned to the (many) correct
values of the predictor variable columns. Since the event code is a
single label, i.e., a 1 or "beep" or 11, dropping it into the variable
columns does not correctly specify the model. Using logged event codes
directly as predictor variables can only work in simple designs with
one factor. It does not generalize to multiple predictor variables.

Furthermore, the relationship between logged integer event codes and
predictor variables in models of real interest is rarely fully
specified when the data are initially recorded. The sequence of events
is not fixed when there is opportunity for human interaction as there
is in any design which involves behavioral responses. For instance
when the event code for a target stimulus is logged, there is no way
to know whether it was detected ("hit") or not ("miss) until a
response is made later. This means the experimental variable
"accuracy" cannot be read off the stimulus event code alone, it is
contingent on a sequence of codes. Furthermore, the relevant factors
and levels may not have been built into the integer codes in the first
place. Perhaps your first hypothesis was a bust and you want to
investigate other variables.  Or Reviewer #2 has a pet theory and
insists some variable be included. The integer event codes fossilized
in the recording have to be recoded after the fact for the variables
you or Reviewer 2 now want to model.

So the general problem is that the time-stamped integer event codes
are fixed once and for all when the data are first recorded but the
variables associated with the event for modeling often are not. The
obvious solution is a look-up table that maps the logged event
codes to the appropriate values of the predictor variables. This
conceptually trivial there are a few complications in practice.

The variables associated with a specific event are often contingent on
whether other events occur and if so when.  The variables always
depend on the model and there are always alternative models. The
events may be initially coded for event type, e.g., codes 1 and 2 for
congruous and incongruous words and the codes may not differentiate
other relevant attributes of the events, e.g., differences in length,
familiarity, age of acquisition of the individual words of the two
types. This means that in practice, the form of the relationship
(mapping) between individual fossilized event codes and the (levels
of) categorical and (values of) continuous predictor variables
included in a given model might be anything: one-to-one, one-to-many,
many-to-one, or many-to_many.

| Example: one-to-one
|    11 = target  
|    12 = distractor

| Example: one-to-many 
|    11 = target
|    11 followed by 3 = target hit
|    11 followed by 4 = target miss

| Example: many-to-one 
|    11 = target
|    21 = target

| Example: many-to-many
|    11 = target
|    11 followed by 3 = target hit
|    11 followed by 4 = target miss
|    21 = target
|    21 followed by 3 = target hit
|    21 followed by 4 = target miss


code tagging
------------

The code tagging approach automates arbitrary mappings from integer
event code (sequences) to categorical and continous predictor
variables for some common cases in designed experiments. The general
framework is built around tidy tabular data structures which
simplifies the implementation of custom re-coding for cases that are
not handled by the automation.

   Three steps from EEG recordings to fixed-length EEG epochs tagged for modeling.


**codemap**
  The *codemap* is a **recipe** for re-coding (tagging) integer event
  codes with the additional categorical and continuous experimental
  variables (tags) as required for modeling real world experimental
  data in informative ways.

  The codemap is a table (rows x columns) where each row is has the form,
  *pattern tag, ..., tag*. This says, "any numerical event code
  (sequence) that matches this regular-expression-like *pattern*, gets
  these *tags*".

  The sample portion of a codemap shown next re-codes integer event 10
  as a hit, miss, or one of two types of anticipation error of
  depending on what the response code is (1040, 1064) and whether it
  occurs after or before the code following the 10. It also tags 10
  with .25, the numeric value of the continuous the continuous
  predictor variable "prob", which gives the probability of the
  stimulus associated with code 10 in the stimlulus sequence. This is
  a stimulus attribute, i.e., not contingent on the response but
  potentially useful to encode for this and the rest of the stimuli if
  we are interested in the relationships between probability and
  accuracy and/or their impact on the EEG response variable we are
  modeling.

  .. table::

     ================   ====  ========  ====  
       regexp           stim  accuracy  prob  
     ================   ====  ========  ====  
      (#10) \\d+ 1040   beep    hit     .25   
      (#10) \\d+ 1064   beep    miss    .25   
      (#10) 1040 \\d+   beep   a_err1   .25   
      (#10) 1064 \\d+   beep   a_err2   .25   
     ================   ====  ========  ====  


  The mapping between the patterns and the tags in a codemap is
  restricted only in that each pattern gets the same number of tags.
  The code patterns can be mapped to tags one-one, one-many, many-one,
  many-many as needed.

  Depending on the specifics of the code pattern and the data, each
  code pattern may match the event data any number of times. A
  cooperative and attentive participant may not make any anticipation
  errors, others may. 

  It is possible and sometimes useful to have different codemaps for
  the same data.



**event table**
  The *event table* is the **result** of sweeping the code patterns
  across the recorded event data and collecting all the matches in
  rows x columns. Each row gives

  * the HDF5 index of the event where the code pattern matched
  * the matched numeric event code
  * the additional tags from the codemap for that pattern

  The event table is a lightweight look-up table (index) back into the
  HDF5 file that says where to find each pattern-matched integer event
  in the EEG recording and what its new categorical and/or continous
  variable tags are (plus other information for checking data
  integrity). By design, the tabular rows = observations x columns = variables
  format of the event table is the same as the familiar observations x
  variables data format assumed by statistical modeling software like
  statsmodels and patsy in Python and lm and lme4 in R.

  Since the codemap tags all and only the relevant events accordingly
  which makes it easy to to tally the events according to stimulus,
  response, and accuracy.

  The rows and columns of the event table can and should be inspected
  to verify that codes were correctly matched and tagged. 

  Event tables may be further modified, e.g., by

  * pruning unnecessary rows (matched events) or columns (tags)
  * adding more  tags (columns) from other data sources
  * adding more matched events (rows) by stacking or slicing the rows
    of other same-shape event tables from the same HDF5 file.


  
**epochs**

  Epochs are fixed-length segments of the EEG and event recordings,
  time-stamped relative to a pattern-matched event code at time = 0
  and tagged with the column variables from the event table. To get
  the epochs data for modeling, the information in the event table is
  stashed alongside the EEG recordings as an *epochs table* by
  providing a name and fixed-length epoch interval boundaries relative
  to the matched event at time 0 (*pre*, *post*). The EEG epochs can
  then be extracted from the HDF5 data file by name as a tidy table of
  indexed tagged tabular multi-channel time-series data. The epochs
  data can be read into the Python environment or exported as a
  separate file in various data interchange formats:

  * native HDF5 (*h5*)
  * pandas.DataFrame pytables HDF5Store (`pdh5`)
  * `feather`

  For working in Python `h5` and `pdh5` are good choices. For working
  in R `feather` is easiest, `h5` also works.  For working in
  MATLAB, *h5* is easiest.

  In the epochs data, the single trial EEG, the fossilized stimulus
  and response event codes, and the new stimulus and response variable
  tags all travel together. This makes it straightforward to verify
  event codes are tagged correctly and to synchronize single trial
  EEG and response measures and anlaysis.
